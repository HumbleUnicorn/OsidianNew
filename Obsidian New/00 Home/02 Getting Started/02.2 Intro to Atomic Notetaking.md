## Three Principles of Personal Knowledge Management
---
### Principle of Atomicity
- *WHAT IT IS:* Notes are limited to one topic, and even one idea. 
- *WHAT IT MEANS:* Any "literature note" is a complete thought in and of itself. 

### Principle of Connectivity
- Link notes together with \[\[Markdown Links]] and/or \#tags 
- Rely less on categorical hierarchies in note organization

### Principle of Personal
- Notes are representations of your own thoughts and creation as opposed to a collection of the words and work of others 

The above principles are in direct contrast to the [Collector's Fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)

### Anatomy of a Zettelkasten Knowledge System
1. *Inbox:* Contains notes you *intend* to create, but have not yet
2. *Archive:* Reliable place where *atomic notes* that you have created are stored. 
3. *Reference Database:* interface to outside world (i.e., citation notes)

This vault also includes: 
1. *Project Management:* A folder to create "note hubs" also called a "map of content" or MOC, which tend to be organized around a specific research or course project. 
2. *Periodic Notes:*  These can support task-oriented notes that you wish to keep separate from your note archive. Periodic notes could be considered a different kind of note hub that is organized by daily goals and agendas instead of by project or topic. 
3. *Vault Assets:* A folder that stores file attachments, templates, and other help files

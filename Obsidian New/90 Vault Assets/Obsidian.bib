  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine 1) the extent to which the gender marketing of toys on the Internet replicates findings of previous studies of the gendering of toys, and 2) the extent to which toys for “both boys and girls”, a previously overlooked category of toys, share characteristics, such as color and type of toy, with toys marketed for “boys only” or for “girls only”. The sample consisted of the 410 toys listed for boys and the 208 toys listed for girls, including 91 toys that appeared on both lists, on the English language U.S. Disney Store website. The marketing of toys on the Disney Store website is important not only because of the growth in e-commerce, but also because of this company’s global domination of the children’s entertainment industry. Tabular analysis and chi-square revealed that bold colored toys, predominantly red, black, brown, or gray toys, and those that were action figures, building toys, weapons, or small vehicles typified toys for “boys only” on this U.S. website. Pastel colored toys, predominantly pink or purple toys, and those that were dolls, beauty, cosmetics, jewelry, or domestic-oriented typified toys for “girls only”. A major- ity of toys for “both boys and girls” were mostly “gender- neutral” in type, but they resembled toys for “boys only” in terms of their color palette, presumably to appeal to boys, who are less likely to cross gender lines than girls. The potential impact of the gendering of toys on individuals as well as limitations of this research and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

Although persistence is studied from many different angles, the majority of studies examining the causes of and cures for students’ departure from college reflect the importance of engagement in the higher education environment. An innovative type of engagement is involving college students in high school outreach. This article reports on a study involving 19 college students who participated in a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded project intended to increase the enrollment and persistence of engineering students, specifically examining how engaging in outreach activities developed participants’ views of themselves as engineers. We found that outreach activities incorporated several types of engagement and that participants engaged in outreach began to develop a professional engineering identity, both of which are linked to college student persistence. The study’s implications for research and practice are discussed.},

Discourse analysis of videotaped science classroom activities, lectures, and laboratories was the primary methodology employed for analyzing students' discursive identity development. This analysis demonstrated differential appropriation of science discourse as four significant domains of discursive identities emerged: Opposition status, Maintenance status, Incorporation status, and Proficiency status. Students characterized as Opposition Status avoided use of science discourse. Students who exhibited Maintenance Status illustrated a commitment to maintaining their normative discourse behavior, despite a demonstrated ability to appropriate science discourse. Students characterized as Incorporation Status made active attempts to incorporate science discourse into their normative speech patterns, while Proficiency Status students demonstrated a fluency in applying scientific discursive. Implications for science education emerging from the study include the illumination of the need to make the use of specific scientific discourse an explicit component of classroom curriculum. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Background: The notion of identity in engineering has become an emerging field in educational research, and many studies focus on the formation of professional engineering identities among undergraduate and career-aged adults, particularly women. Little is known about how pre-adolescents begin to construct their earliest conceptions of engineering and potential career aspirations. Further, there is little research on measuring young learners' engineering identity development. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the development of the Engineering Identity Development Scale (EIDS), an instrument designed to assess elementary school students' identity development in engineering. This study describes a three-phase approach to item construction, administration, and the gathering of reliable and valid evidence for scores on the EIDS. Design/Method: Item construction and administration of the instrument were conducted, and tests of reliability (internal consistency) and validity (content and internal structure) of the EIDS's scores were undertaken. The EIDS was intended to include four factors: (1) academic identity, (2) school identity, (3) occupational identity, and 4) engineering aspirations. Results: Findings indicate that two rather than four factors best describe young children's identity: academic and engineering career. Results provide initial support for score reliability and validity of the EIDS. Conclusion: The reliability and validity evidence support the proposed use of the EIDS instrument. Recommendations for infusing EIDS into science and engineering education and into research related to gender, identity, and learning in science and engineering education are suggested.}

The most popular board game in history can trace its origins back to 1904, when Elizabeth Magie created "The Landlord's Game," which was designed as a tool to teach the principles of land ownership. In the mid-1930s, Charles Darrow produced his own version, dubbed "Monopoly," and sold it to Parker Brothers. In 1916, John Lloyd Wright (son of famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright) witnessed the building techniques employed on the Imperial Palace Hotel in Tokyo, Japan. He was then inspired to create the timeless building system known as Lincoln Logs. And in 1971, two men created an adventure where the game board existed solely in one's imagination. The Fantasy Game, dreamed up by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, was republished in 1974 as the highly influential role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

Dubbed LEGO® Data Acquisition and Prototyping System (or LDAPS), this combination of tools provides a highly capable workbench for students, yet brings a new level of creativity and fun into teaching engineering at the college level. In this paper we present the methodology and describe one class where it is currently in use. Student, faculty, and staff response to the class was very positive, partly due to the popularity of hands-on engineering and partly because LEGO® blocks allow the students to exercise their creativity and innovation. The strength in the LDAPS methodology lies in the power of the LEGO® bricks and the LabVIEWTM software. LEGO® motors, sensors, and bricks are almost infinitely configurable, making each experiment unique. LabVIEWTM is a powerful, visual programming language in which students can perform advanced signal processing with relatively few programming skills. We are currently extending this methodology to teach engineering to liberal arts majors as well as precollege students.},

In the paper, we explain how we designed software to complement these projects in allowing automation and animation. The software uses LabVIEW, extending its capabilities to kindergartners and LEGO bricks. Finally, we will show how we have used LabVIEW and LEGO data acquisition to teach elementary school science, freshman engineering, instrumentation and experimentation, and how college seniors and graduate students have used both the hardware and software to solve various data acquisition problems.

This article seeks to assist stakeholders to better understand the ethical and scientific assumptions that underlie the two opposing positions in this debate, and assess their relative strength. There is apparent consensus in the underlying ethical foundations of the debate, with all commentators seeming to endorse the values of corporate social responsibility and gender equality. However, the debate splits over three critical points of empirical disagreement: whether gendered toy marketing influences children’s toy preferences or simply reflects boys’ and girls’ fundamentally different interests; whether the effects of gendered toy marketing are negative, neutral or beneficial; and whether a shift to gender-neutral marketing would be economically viable. We assess the three points of disagreement against the available evidence and shared ethical principles underlying the debate, and conclude that current defences of gendered toy marketing fail.},

Children (n = 116, Mage = 7.27 range = 5–10) were given the opportunity to build with LEGO® brick sets, both instructed and free play tasks. For the instructed task, the type of object (feminine: cat; masculine: dinosaur) and color of the bricks (pink, blue) were counterbalanced across participants. Their play was coded for accuracy of following the instructions and time to complete the task. In the free play task, brick color (pink, blue) was counterbalanced across participants, and structures were coded for femininity/masculinity and the number of bricks used. Overall, children took longer to build a feminine object with blue bricks than with pink bricks. In the free-play task, boys built more masculine objects than girls did, regardless of the color of bricks they were given. Results showed that boys completed the LEGO® tasks faster than did girls, controlling for interest in and experience with LEGO® play.

While the use of LSP discussed here focuses on its implementation on creative arts courses, it is a highly transferable methodology which can be applied across the spectrum of disciplines and for multiple purposes.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in spatial functioning are frequently the source of cocktail party conversation and entertaining cartoons. These anecdotes and images feature such figures as men who forge intrepidly into the wild armed only with a compass and an innate sense of direction and ditzy women who hold maps upside down and depend on the kindness of strangers. These figures of fun, although exaggerated, have some basis in truth. Studies using standardized tests have found support for the belief that men have strengths in the spatial domain, sometimes quite marked strengths. For example, the average American man has an ability to perform mental rotation of a three-dimensional object that exceeds that of the average American woman by half a standard deviation or more (Linn \& Petersen, 1985; Voyer, Voyer, \& Bryden, 1995; for the statistically uninitiated, such differences are considered moderate to large and may well be obvious to the casual observer). There are similarly substantial sex-related differences on tests of mechanical reasoning, which involve a large spatial component (Feingold, 1995). Furthermore, and consistent with remarks made in January 2005 by Lawrence Summers, the president of Harvard University, these differences are often most marked at the upper end of the distribution. That is, men outnumber women by especially large ratios at the highest levels of these abilities (Feingold, 1995; Hedges \& Nowell, 1995). Lastly, in what may seem to be the final step in a devastating argument, such differences have been found to be relevant to success in science for men and women, both because mathematical ability may rest partially on spatial ability (Casey, Nuttall, \& Pezaris, 1997, 2001) and also because spatial visualization is directly relevant to achievement in many scientific and technical fields, including physical science, mathematics, computer science, and engineering (Shea, Lubinski, \&. Benbow, 2001). So, given these facts, was Summers correct in speculating that women may be held back from success in science partly because they lack the cognitive prerequisites? I think the answer is yes, at a superficial level, because his descriptive facts were right--although I am not sure that the proportion of variance accounted for by cognitive variables is that large in comparison with issues such as family-work conflicts. However at a deeper level, I think the answer is no, he was incorrect, because these "facts" reflexively evoke in most people two unwarranted assumptions: that any sex-related differences are biologically caused and that they are hence immutable. (The "hence" in that last sentence is itself problematic, because many biologically caused conditions can be easily addressed by interventions, as when we color our graying hair or treat our children's ear infections with antibiotics. Yet for most people there is a linkage, albeit a mistaken one, between biology and immutability.) In this chapter, I address each assumption in two parts. For biological causation, I first present an extremely brief overview of the current state of evidence, and then I concentrate on the evolutionary psychology framework that currently provides the primary scientific basis for taking biology very seriously, pointing out its grave inconsistencies and gaps in logic. Turning to the issue of immutability, I discuss evidence that spatial ability levels can fairly easily be increased overall. I then focus on the issue of whether sex-related differences can be eliminated and whether that matters, arguing that increasing the abilities of both women and men should be the key goal.

This study focused on examining the differential impact of structured block play and board games on spatial processing. Two groups of 8-year-old children were studied. One group participated in a five session block play training paradigm and the second group had a similar training protocol but played a word/spelling board game. A mental rotation task was assessed before and after training. The mental rotation task was performed during fMRI to observe the neural changes associated with the two play protocols. Only the block play group showed effects of training for both behavioral measures and fMRI measured brain activation. Behaviorally, the block play group showed improvements in both reaction time and accuracy. Additionally, the block play group showed increased involvement of regions that have been linked to spatial working memory and spatial processing after training. The board game group showed non-significant improvements in mental rotation performance, likely related to practice effects, and no training related brain activation differences. While the current study is preliminary, it does suggest that different “spatial” play activities have differential impacts on spatial processing with structured block play but not board games showing a significant impact on mental rotation performance.},

  abstract = {LEGO® construction sets are a staple in many children’s lives. Given worldwide distribution, generations of children have grown up playing with these brightly colored, interlocking plastic bricks. Historically marketed to all children, the LEGO® Group has begun targeting male and female consumers differentially with the introduction of product lines such as LEGO® City and LEGO® Friends. Although the packaging, marketing, brick colors, and characters have changed, little is known about whether these product series encourage differences in the way boys and girls play. This content analysis compared the play narratives of sets marketed to boys (LEGO® City) and girls (LEGO® Friends). Our analysis found distinct gendered messages that encourage boys to enact various skilled professions, heroism, and expertise, whereas girls are encouraged to focus on having hobbies, being domestic, caring for others, socializing, being amateurs, and appreciating and striving for beauty. Although LEGO® City and Friends sets offer opportunities for construction, they also promote stereotyped gender roles for enacting femininity and masculinity in play. Parents, educators, and practitioners often focus on the educational affordances of LEGO® construction. We recommend that they also consider the other lessons, both explicit and implicit, being taught through gender-specific LEGO® sets.},

A review of the literature concluded that research on engineering identity development has increased over the past ten years, has been conducted primarily with qualitative methods, and has been primarily limited to academic communities focused on mathematics, science, and engineering education. In addition, current scholarship reflected that most of the work in this area has focused on the learning contexts and experiences of women and underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities with less focus on men, international, or graduate students. Future scholarship in this area should focus on expanding forms of engineering identity frameworks and focus to facilitate greater understanding of engineering identity development.},

  abstract = {When looking at learning processes from an interactionist perspective, interaction between individuals is seen as central for learning. In order to understand and describe these interactions and therefore the learning processes, a method was developed in mathematics education grounded in the theory of Symbolic Interactionism and Ethnomethodology—the Interactional Analysis. In this chapter, at first the underlying theory for the Interactional Analysis is presented, before the steps of the method are explained, giving an example for each step. Findings of research using this method have been widely published, however, the method has not been described in depth in English yet. Therefore, this chapter makes a valuable contribution for enabling this method to be more accessible for an international research community, as well as helping international researchers understand the findings produced by using this method more clearly.},

Undergraduates participated in repeated testing on the MRT or played the videogame Tetris. Analyses showed large improvements in mental rotation with both repeated testing and training; these gains were maintained several months later. MRT scores of men and women did not converge, but men showed faster initial growth and women showed more improvement later. Videogame training showed greater initial growth than repeated testing alone, but final performance did not differ. Effects of videogame training transferred to other spatial tasks exceeding the effects of repeated testing, and this transfer advantage was still evident after several months.

  abstract = {Background: Impairment of executive function (EF), the goal-directed regulation of thoughts, actions, and emotions, drives negative outcomes and is common across neurodevelopmental disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A primary challenge to its amelioration is heterogeneity in symptom expression within and across disorders. Parsing this heterogeneity is necessary to attain diagnostic precision, a goal of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria Initiative. We aimed to identify transdiagnostic subtypes of EF that span the normal to impaired spectrum and establish their predictive and neurobiological validity.; Methods: Community detection was applied to clinical parent-report measures in 8-14-year-old children with and without ADHD and ASD from two independent cohorts (discovery N~=~320; replication N~=~692) to identify subgroups with distinct behavioral profiles. Support vector machine (SVM) classification was used to predict subgroup membership of unseen cases. Preliminary neurobiological validation was obtained with existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on a subsample (N~=~84) by testing hypotheses about sensitivity of EF subgroups versus DSM categories.; Results: We observed three transdiagnostic EF subtypes characterized by behavioral profiles that were defined by relative weakness in: (a) flexibility and emotion regulation; (b) inhibition; and (c) working memory, organization, and planning. The same tripartite structure was also present in the typically developing children. SVM trained on the discovery sample and tested on the replication sample classified subgroup membership with 77.0\% accuracy. Split-half SVM classification on the combined sample (N~=~1,012) yielded 88.9\% accuracy (this SVM is available for public use). As hypothesized, frontal-parietal engagement was better distinguished by EF subtype than DSM diagnosis and the subgroup characterized with inflexibility failed to modulate right IPL activation in response to increased executive demands.; Conclusions: The observed transdiagnostic subtypes refine current diagnostic nosology and augment clinical decision-making for personalizing treatment of executive dysfunction in children.

A specific version of embodied learning posits an action-to-abstraction transition supported by gesture, sketching, and analogical mapping. These tools seem to have special promise for bolstering learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, but existing efforts need further theoretical and empirical development. The topical collection in Cognitive Research: Principles includes articles aiming to formalize and test the effectiveness of embodied learning in STEM. The collection provides guideposts, staking out the terrain that should be surveyed before larger-scale efforts are undertaken. This introduction provides a broader context concerning mechanisms that can support embodied learning and make it especially well suited to the STEM disciplines.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the particular aspects of learning which might be supported through playful activity and reviews research and theory which link children’s play, and particularly pretence or symbolic play, to the development of metacognitive and self-regulatory skills. Three studies are reported, one observational and two experimental, which have explored this relationship. The observational study involved the video-recording of 582 metacognitive or self-regulatory ‘events’ within Foundation Stage settings. The two experimental studies replicated in different learning domains the classic study of Sylva, Bruner and Genova (1976), which contrasted the problem-solving performance of 3- to 5-year-old children who had experienced a ‘taught’ and ‘play’ condition. Evidence from the present studies reported and other studies supports the view that play, and particularly pretence or symbolic play, which might be with objects or other children, is particularly significant in its contribution to the development of children as metacognitively skilful, self-regulated learners. Evidence from the observational study indicated that child-initiated playful activities, in small groups without adult supervision, supported the greatest proportion of self-regulatory behaviours. The experimental studies suggested that the experience of the ‘play’ condition was particularly effective in preparing the children for effortful, problem-solving or creative tasks which require a high level of metacognitive and self-regulatory skill. Metacognitive and self-regulatory development is crucially important in the development of academic skills which involve intentional learning, problem-solving and creativity. An understanding of the relationship between pretend or symbolic play and self-regulation is also helpful in providing clear guidelines for adults working with young children as regards their role in supporting and encouraging play in educational contexts.},

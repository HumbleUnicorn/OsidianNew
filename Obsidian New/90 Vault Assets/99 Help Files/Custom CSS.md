## Customizing Your Vault
- CSS styles ARE customizable (i.e., fonts, colors, etc.). If you don't link the look and feel of the settings in this vault, you can: 
	- Changing theme to something you like better
	- Edit the source theme CSS (not recommended, any changes will be overridden with each theme update; and these happen more often than you might think)
	- Create your own custom CSS snippets (best)
 

## Recommended Tools For Customization
- *Custom CSS:* See [Style Settings](Style%20Settings.md) for examples of how to create Style Setting options in your vault. 
- *Custom CSS Examples:* See [Ebullientworks](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-theme-ebullientworks) theme for examples of customizable Style Settings. <span class="comment">%%  The developer of this theme happens to be my sister, so if you have questions, I can help you get answers very quickly! %%</span>
- *Color Palette Generator:* Try [coolers.co](https://coolors.co/) if you want to generate color palettes that are pleasing to the eyeballs, and test contrasts for accents colors. 
- *Color Palette CSS Generator:* Try [Grayscale Design](https://grayscale.design/) to create grayscales of selected colors, and export CSS Variables (RBG tuples or HEX)
- *Fonts:* Choose fonts at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Instructions of how to load them into your vault and make them accessible can be found in [Style Settings](Style%20Settings.md).
